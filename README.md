Building a long-term relationship with your Rails applications - Presentation
=============================================================================

This originally was a presentation outline by @joealba, but now it is open for anyone who wishes to contribute.

Clone it and give the presentation when it is more complete.  Go for it!

For now we just have the basic outline.  Then it will become a presentation using the Parade gem -- because Parade is awesome and cross-platform compatible.

### Yan Pritzker from Reverb.com has done an excellent job of illustrating his views on many of the points in this presentation outline at Windy City Rails 2014
